        <p> Tommy’s Margarita, which was created by Julio Bermejo in the early ’90s at Tommy’s Mexican Restaurant, a San Francisco favorite dating back to 1965.
            Tommy’s version is characterized by its lack of orange liqueur. (Some bartenders argue that eliminating the orange liqueur makes this version not a Margarita. 
            But that is a story for another time.) Rather than using the sweetener to balance the tequila and lime, Bermejo relies solely on agave nectar, made from the 
            same plant that produces tequila. This simple swap creates a cocktail that tastes similar to the original and saves the drinker a few calories. 
            It became emblematic of the lighter, fresher style of eating and drinking that was taking place in California around the end of the twentieth
            century and still drives much of the culinary and bar scene today.</p>
